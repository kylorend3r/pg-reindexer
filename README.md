## Purpose and Definition

PostgreSQL's native `REINDEX` command is powerful but lacks the orchestration capabilities needed for production environments. This Rust-based tool bridges that gap by providing:

- **Safe Concurrent Operations and Resource Management**: Thread-safe reindexing with built-in conflict detection and configurable threading for optimal performance vs. resource usage
- **Replication Safety**: Advanced checks for replication slots and sync connections
- **Production Safety**: Built-in safeguards against maintenance operations (VACUUM etc..) and previous active reindexer sessions.
- **Granular Control**: Target specific schemas or tables to create a different indexing strategies increasing flexibility.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track all reindex operations with detailed before/after metrics

### Key Features

#### üéØ **Granular Control for Maintenance Categorization**
- **Schema-level operations**: Reindex all indexes in a specific schema for comprehensive maintenance
- **Table-level precision**: Target specific tables for focused maintenance cycles
- **Categorized maintenance**: Organize maintenance processes by business logic (e.g., user tables, order tables, reporting tables)

#### üîß **Smart Index Selection**
- **B-tree focus**: Optimized for the most common index type in PostgreSQL
- **Constraint awareness**: Automatically skips primary keys and unique constraints (which can't use CONCURRENTLY)
- **Size filtering**: Exclude oversized indexes that could impact system performance
- **Safe operations**: Only processes indexes that can be safely reindexed concurrently

#### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization Through Threading**
- **Configurable concurrency**: Control how fast you want to complete tasks (1-16+ threads)
- **Resource management**: Balance speed vs. system resource consumption
- **Adaptive processing**: Scale up for maintenance windows, scale down for production hours
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time monitoring of concurrent operations

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Built for Safety and Reliability**
- **Non-blocking operations**: Uses `REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to minimize downtime
- **Conflict detection**: Automatically skips operations when vacuums or other processes are active
- **Replication safety**: Built-in checks for inactive replication slots and sync replication connections
- **Production controls**: Configurable safety overrides for maintenance windows and emergency operations
- **Index validation**: Automatic integrity checks after each reindex operation
- **Dry run mode**: Preview operations before execution
- **Resource protection**: Configurable maintenance work memory and parallel worker limits to protect production systems

## Production System Protection

The tool includes advanced resource management features to protect production systems while optimizing performance:

### Memory Management (`maintenance_work_mem`)

The `maintenance_work_mem` parameter is critical for index operation performance:

- **Performance Impact**: Larger values enable faster index operations by providing more memory for sorting and building operations
- **Memory Usage**: Each parallel worker uses this amount of memory, so total usage = `maintenance_work_mem √ó max_parallel_maintenance_workers`
- **Production Safety**: Default of 1 GB is conservative to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Optimization Strategy**: 
  - Small indexes (< 1GB): 1-2 GB is sufficient
  - Large indexes (> 10GB): 4-8 GB can significantly improve performance
  - Monitor system memory usage during operations

### Parallel Worker Management (`max_parallel_maintenance_workers`)

The `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` parameter controls parallel index operations:

- **Safety Validation**: Automatically checks against system `max_parallel_workers` setting
- **Resource Protection**: Enforces limit of `max_parallel_workers/2` to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Performance Scaling**: Enables parallel index operations for improved throughput
- **Production Guidelines**:
  - **Production Hours**: 1-2 workers (minimal impact)
  - **Maintenance Windows**: 4-8 workers (high performance)
  - **Emergency Operations**: 1 worker (maximum safety)


## Database Schema

The tool automatically creates a `reindexer` schema with a `reindex_logbook` table to track reindexing operations:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA reindexer;

CREATE TABLE reindexer.reindex_logbook (
    schema_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    index_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    index_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    reindex_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    reindex_status VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    before_size BIGINT,
    after_size BIGINT,
    size_change BIGINT
);
```

### Logbook Status Values

- `success`: Index was successfully reindexed and validated
- `validation_failed`: Index reindexing completed but validation failed
- `skipped`: Index was skipped due to active vacuum or other pgreindexer processes
